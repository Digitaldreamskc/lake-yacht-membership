# Tokenized Membership System - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The client requires a comprehensive tokenized membership system that integrates:
- Base blockchain for NFT minting and membership management
- Privy wallet for seamless user authentication and transaction handling
- NFT-based membership tokens that serve as digital identity
- Physical NFC chipped cards linked to the digital NFTs for real-world usage

This system will provide users with a seamless way to purchase memberships, receive NFT tokens, and use both digital and physical membership cards for identification both online and in the real world.

## Lessons

### User Specified Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before you try to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command

### Project-Specific Lessons
1. **Node.js Version Compatibility**: Hardhat 3.0.0+ requires Node.js 22.10.0+, but many development environments still use Node.js 20.x. Always check version requirements before installing development tools.
2. **ESM vs CommonJS**: Modern blockchain development tools are moving to ESM modules, which can cause compatibility issues with existing CommonJS projects. Consider this when planning project structure.
3. **Smart Contract Enhancement**: When enhancing existing contracts, maintain backward compatibility and ensure all new functionality is properly tested. The NFC card functionality was successfully integrated without breaking existing features.
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralizing configuration in a single file (lib/config.ts) makes it easier to manage environment variables and network settings across the entire application.
