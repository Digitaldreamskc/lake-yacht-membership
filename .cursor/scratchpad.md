# DreamLayer IP Registration System - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The client requires a comprehensive IP registration system on Story Protocol that integrates:
- 6551 token-bound accounts for IP registration and management
- 7160 dynamic NFTs with real-time metadata updates
- Story Protocol integration for IP registration and licensing
- Dynamic metadata types including weather, time, GPS, and other real-time data sources
